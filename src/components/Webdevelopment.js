            <p>To understand web development first of all lets understand the meaning of web development separately:-
             <ul >
                <li><strong>Web:-</strong>It refers to websites, web pages or anything that works over the internet.</li>
                <li><strong>Development:-</strong>It refers to building the application from scratch.</li>
             </ul>
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>Hence,<strong>Web development </strong>refers to the creating, building, and maintaining of websites. It includes aspects such as web design, web publishing, web programming, and database management. It is the creation of an application that works over the internet i.e. websites.</p>
